\section{Descriptive statistic}

We have $20$ variables in our dataset of which $2$ are qualitative. The \textit{status} indicates if the country is developped or developping and the \textit{adult.mortality} feature categorize the probability of dying between $15$ and $60$ years old into five levels: very low, low, middle, high, very high. 

More generally, we can classify the different variables into several categories: \textit{economic} (country status, expenditure on health, gdp, hdi), \textit{social} (total population of each country, number of years of schooling), \textit{mortality} (adult mortality, infant death, under five death, under four death because of HIV/AIDS, thinness) and \textit{immunization} factors (immunization of hepatitis b, polia, diphteria as well as number of reported cases of measles). We will only describe some variables, the curious reader can find a complete description of these in the appendix.

The \textit{hepatitis.b}, \textit{polio} and \textit{diphteria} variables are respectively the immunization coverages against hepatitis B, polio and DPT3 (diphteria tetanus toxoid and pertussis) among the $1$ year olds and are given in percentage.

The \textit{alcohol} variable is the consumption of alcohol per capita (of $15$ years old or more) in litres of pure alcohol.

\subsection{Qualitative variables}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Quantitative variables}

Let's take a look to the table of the 4 moments (\textit{mean}, \textit{standard deviation}, \textit{skewness} and \textit{kurtosis}) for each of the quantitative variables. 

\begin{figure}[H]

	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/eda/quantitative_variables_moments.png}
	\caption{table of moments (mean, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis) for the quantitative variables}
	\label{fig:quantitative_variables_moments}
\end{figure}

We will not describe every variable in details since there are a lot but we will try to summarize the above table instead.

% TARGET

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics{figures/eda/histogram_boxplot_target.png}
	\caption{Histogram and boxplot of the target variable (life expectancy)}
	\label{fig:histogram_boxplot_target}
\end{figure}

The \textbf{life expectancy} has a mean of roughly $70$ years with a standard deviation of $8.6$. It is slightly negatively skewed which indicates that some countries have low life expectancy. The kurtosis is less than $3$ so the distribution is a litlle bit flattened.

We can see that some features have a high standard deviation. For example, the \textbf{infant.deaths} variable has a mean of $\approx 31 / 1000$ but a standard diviation of $112.6$ which means that some countries have far more child mortality than others. We also see that the expenditure on health services, the number of measles cases per 1000 inhabitants and the GDP are not homogeneous among the different countries represented in this dataset. The hepatitis B, polio and diphetria coverages are pretty much similar. The average BMI is $38$ which means obesity but we have to pay attention that the standard deviation is pretty high so we cannot intepret that in average the countries have an obese population. The number of years of schooling last $12 \pm 2$ years in average. The prevalence of thinness among children and adolescents is of $4\%$ in average but can be close to $0$ considering the standard deviation. Checking the \textbf{income.composition.of.resources} variable, we notice that based on the productive resources, the countries have an HDI greater than $0.5$.

Looking at the histograms and boxplots in the appendix, we can see that some countries spend far more money on health services than most of the others. we notice that the child (less than five years old) death and the number of measle cases are low among most of countries. Unfortunately, a group of countries have not a good coverage against polio, hepatitis B and diphteria. Eventually, we notice 2 groups for the BMI, a group of countries has a BMI around 20 but another around 60 !


The \textbf{infant death} has a mean of $31 / 1000$ but has a huge standard deviation ($112.6$). We see that heavily tailed with a kurtosis of $66.9$. The same kind of conclusion can be made for the \textbf{deaths under five year old}.

In average, countries spend $9$ times the GDP\footnote{Gross Domestic Product} per capita on health services but the standard deviation is huge ($1931.8$) which indicates the presence of outliers far away from the mean. Therefore, we expect that some countries spend much less than that on health services.

Furthermore, in average, countries spend $6 \%$ of their total budget on health services. The distribution of this variable seems to follow a normal distribution given the skewness and kurtosis.

\subsection{Correlation matrix}

We look at the correlation matrix in order to see if there are any highly correlated variables. Indeed, it could be a sign of multicollinearity

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics{figures/eda/correlation_matrix.png}
	\caption{correlation matrix of dataset}
	\label{fig:correlation_matrix}
\end{figure}

We see that severall variables are highly correlated:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The \textbf{infant death} is perfectly correlated with the \textbf{death under five year old}: these two features are redundant. As a consequence, we're gonna remove \textit{under.five.death} feature from our dataset.
	\item The \textbf{thinness from $5$ to $9$ years old} with the \textbf{thinness from $10$ to $19$ years old}: we could suspect that extreme thinness comes from a problem of access to food which implies that thinness doesn't stop at $10$ years old but continue throughout the teenage.
	\item The \textbf{number of measles cases per 1000 inhabitants} with the \textbf{infant death}: indeed, measle hits essentially children and youth and can (often) lead to death.
	\item The \textbf{percentage of expenditure made on health services} with the \textbf{GDP per capita}.
	\item The \textbf{hepatitis B} and \textbf{polio} with \textbf{diphteria}.
	\item The \textbf{life expectancy} with the \textbf{HDI in terms of income composition of resources} and \textbf{schooling}.
\end{itemize}
